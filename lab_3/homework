Question 1: What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?


SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM `my-ny-taxy.taxi.taxi`
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tpep_pickup_datetime) = 2024;
20332057

65,623
840,402
20,332,093 *
85,431,289



Question 2:


CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `my-ny-taxy.taxi.materialized_yellow_taxi` AS
SELECT *
FROM `my-ny-taxy.taxi.external_taxi_table`;



SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM `my-ny-taxy.taxi.materialized_yellow_taxi`;

Внешняя таблица:

Запрос возвращает 20,332,093 записей.
BigQuery оценивает объем данных, считываемых при запросе, примерно в 18.82 MB.
Материализованная таблица:

Запрос возвращает такое же количество записей (20,332,093).
При выполнении запроса оценка обработанных байт составляет около 47.60 MB.


Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.
What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?

18.82 MB for the External Table and 47.60 MB for the Materialized Table
0 MB for the External Table and 155.12 MB for the Materialized Table
2.14 GB for the External Table and 0MB for the Materialized Table
0 MB for the External Table and 0MB for the Materialized Table


Question 3: (solved)
Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table. Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?
* BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated number of bytes processed.
BigQuery duplicates data across multiple storage partitions, so selecting two columns instead of one requires scanning the table twice, doubling the estimated bytes processed.
BigQuery automatically caches the first queried column, so adding a second column increases processing time but does not affect the estimated bytes scanned.
When selecting multiple columns, BigQuery performs an implicit join operation between them, increasing the estimated bytes processed

BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID and DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying just one column (PULocationID), which leads to a higher estimated number of bytes processed

Question 4: (solved)
How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS zero_fare_count
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.trips`
WHERE
  fare_amount = 0;

8333

128,210
546,578
20,188,016
8,333 *


Question 5: (solved)
What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy)

* Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID
Cluster on by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID
Cluster on tpep_dropoff_datetime Partition by VendorID
Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Partition by VendorID

The best strategy is to Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID.



Question 6:
Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)

Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?

Choose the answer which most closely matches.

12.47 MB for non-partitioned table and 326.42 MB for the partitioned table
310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table
5.87 MB for non-partitioned table and 0 MB for the partitioned table
310.31 MB for non-partitioned table and 285.64 MB for the partitioned table


Question 7: (solved)
Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?

Big Query
Container Registry
* GCP Bucket
Big Table

When you create an external table in BigQuery, the table itself only contains metadata that points to the location of the actual data. In this case, the data is stored in a GCP Bucket (i.e., Google Cloud Storage).

Question 8: (solved)
It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data:

True
* False

False
(Bonus: Not worth points) 

Question 9:
No Points: Write a SELECT count(*) query FROM the materialized table you created. How many bytes does it estimate will be read? Why?
